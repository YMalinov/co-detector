# co-detector
### Abstract
A CO (carbon monoxide) detector for the garage. Working on gasoline vehicles and making them run well, does produce a lot of stray CO, which can be a health hazard, hence the need for this project. Basic requirements include: an audible signal if a certain ppm (parts-per-million) CO threshold is met; a screen able to show you the current reading; a proximity sensor, able to activate said screen (easy way to activate screen, if hands are dirty), which would later timeout after a certain amount of time.
